There was an oddness about that terrible day in May which is worth recording:
not only at the kiosk but along the whole avenue parallel to Malaya Bronnaya
Street there was not a person to be seen. It was the hour of the day when
people feel too exhausted to breathe, when Moscow glows in a dry haze as the
sun disappears behind the Sadovaya Boulevard - yet no one had come out for
a walk under the limes, no one was sitting on a bench, the avenue was empty.
