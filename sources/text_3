You had three weeks. The universe was created in a third of that time.
Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna announce the names of everyone who designed the launch demo.
I'm gonna introduce everyone and ask them to stand up. The bag was designed by Susan Kare, the Macintosh
font that's crawling across the screen was designed by Steve Capps, the starry night and sky writing was
Bruce Horn. Down to the calculator. And then I'm gonna say the voice demo that didn't work, was designed
by Andy Herztfeld. 5 in 6 is your first chance of surviving the first round of Russian Roulette,
and you've reversed those odds. So unless you wanna be disgraced in front of your friends, family,
colleagues, stockholders and the press, I wouldn't stand here arguing. I'd go try get some more bullets
out of the gun.
Do it, Andy!
